Notes:
I disabled cull facing in ProblemB123 at the very start... for some reason
it is enabled, which resulted in the sphere that first pops up appearing
weird. I merely reflected what was done in ProblemA1 (since it's also disabled
in the beginning there as well). The lines I changed are preceded by a TODO
statement - line 364

Besides this, no known problems!
